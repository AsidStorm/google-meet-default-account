        <h3>What is an AuthUser ID?</h3>
        <p>To find the authUser ID for the Google account you want to set as default:
        <ul>
            <li>Go to meet.google.com</li>
            <li>Using the account switcher in the top right, switch to the google account you want as your default</li>
            <li>After the page reloads with the desired account active, there will be a <em>authuser=</em> section added
                to
                the url. The number that follows this is your authUser ID</li>
        </ul>
        If the first account that Google Meet opened is your desired account, your authUser ID is 0 (and you probably
        don't need this extension)
        </p>
